The overriding idea for the logic is to have five states for the calculator using the variable stateOfCalc. Each EventListener for
buttons being clicked tests the stateOfCalc using a 'switch' 'case' setup. 

The calculator accepts (number) (operation) (equals) to mean operating the number with itself, e.g. 6 * = 36.
